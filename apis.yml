  The Bureau of Industry Security (BIS) is a division of the U.S. Department of
  Commerce that is responsible for implementing and enforcing export control
  regulations to protect national security and prevent the proliferation of
  weapons of mass destruction. BIS reviews license applications for the export
  of sensitive goods and technologies, conducts outreach and education on
  compliance with export control laws, and investigates allegations of export
  violations. The bureau works closely with other government agencies, industry
  partners, and international organizations to address emerging threats and
  promote responsible trade practices. In sum, BIS plays a crucial role in
  safeguarding the nation's security interests while facilitating legitimate
  trade and economic growth.
